# Morse Code Translator

**A basic Morse code translator that allows you to convert text to Morse code and Morse code back to text.**

## Features

*   **Bidirectional Translation:** Convert plain English text to Morse code and decode Morse code back to text.
*   **Simple & Lightweight:** Minimal logic-focused implementation without external dependencies.
*   **Error Handling:** Detects and reports invalid characters during translation.
*   **Readable Output:** Uses / to clearly separate words in Morse code.

## Technologies Used

*   **PYTHON:** Used for the entire translation logic.
