# Morse Code Translator

**A basic Morse code translator that allows you to convert text to Morse code and Morse code back to text.**

## Author
Created by `halfpace`

## Features

*   **Bidirectional Translation:** Convert plain English text to Morse code and decode Morse code back to text.
*   **Simple & Lightweight:** Minimal logic-focused implementation without external dependencies.
*   **Error Handling:** Detects and reports invalid characters during translation.
*   **Readable Output:** Uses / to clearly separate words in Morse code.

## Technologies Used

*   **PYTHON:** Used for the entire translation logic.

## NOTES
- Letters are separated by spaces in Morse code.
- Words are separated using /.
- Input is case-insensitive for text-to-Morse conversion.

### Example
```sh
Input:  I AM
Output: .. / .- --
```
